## Context

We make a little json file about some transfers in football and we wanted at the end to put these data into the database using springboot xml

## Result

We tried in this project to :

- Play with a json file and get the new content into another json file.
- Insert into a H2 database the content of the original json file using h2 jdbc library.

All of this in vain. We are not friednly with spring boot xml and the configuration was painful to make things looks alright, we understand what we did but 
it didn't work as expected.

## Conclusion

You can find everything about this project in the package "amraoui_tobbal.project" for the java part and "resources" for the xml part.

NB : The tests package in both java and xml resources are the solution of the lab we made with the professor.
